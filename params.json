Among various meta-properties established for DCML and DCLML, we obtain one stating that every cut between three (or more) sequents (as a generalization of a cut between two sequents) can be elmininated, thus extending the celebrated result of cut-elimination by Gentzen.\r\n\r\n## Papers\r\n\r\n* Hongwei Xi, Zhiqiang Ren, Hanwen Wu, William Blair. **[Session Types in a Linearly Typed Multi-Threaded Lambda-Calculus](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03727)** (2016)\r\n* Hongwei Xi, Hanwen Wu. **[Linearly Typed Dyadic Group Sessions for Building Multiparty Sessions](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03020)** (2016)\r\n\r\n## Full Proof\r\n\r\n<iframe src='https://glot.io/snippets/eel4cuqav8/embed' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' sandbox='allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts' width='600' height='400'></iframe>",
