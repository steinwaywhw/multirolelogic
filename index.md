# Multirole Logic

We identify multirole logic as a new form of logic in which conjunction/disjunction is interpreted as an ultrafilter on the power set of some underlying set (of roles) and the notion of negation is generalized to endomorphisms on this underlying set. We formalize both multirole logic (MRL) and linear multirole logic (LMRL) as natural generalizations of classical logic (CL) and classical linear logic (CLL), respectively, and also present a filter-based interpretation for intuitionism in multirole logic. Among various meta-properties established for MRL and LMRL, we obtain one named **multiparty cut-elimination** stating that every cut involving one or more sequents (as a generalization of a binary cut involving exactly two sequents) can be eliminated, thus extending the celebrated result of cut-elimination by Gentzen.

It's code can be found [here](https://github.com/steinwaywhw/nepls-15-demo) which also includes a simple encoding of ConcurrentML.

# Full Proofs

These proofs are formulated and checked in an older version of ATS and z3.^[It may broke if the version is seriously outdated.] We recommend that you verify one proof at a time and comment out others to make it possible to verify within resource limit.

# Implementations

Our work has enabled several implementations. The session API formulation is done in [Applied Type System](www.ats-lang.org). After type checking, it will be compiled into a target language. Currently we experimented several such targets, including C, JavaScript, and Elixir/Erlang.

* [ATS/Elixir, ATS/Erlang](https://github.com/steinwaywhw/ats-session-playground). This repo contains several async message-passing implementation on top of the ErlangVM, covering binary sessions, naive multiparty sessions, and multiparty sessions based on LMRL in a different branch. We are currently working on re-organising the code base.

* ATS/C. [Repo 1](https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats/tree/master/npm-utils/contrib/libats-/hwxi/mysession-2) and [repo 2](https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats/tree/master/npm-utils/contrib/libats-/hwxi/mysession-g) are two implementations of binary session types and multiparty session types, respectively. They are described in Hongwei Xi, Hanwen Wu. [**Linearly Typed Dyadic Group Sessions for Building Multiparty Sessions**](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03020) (2016). You can also find them on [npm, binary](https://www.npmjs.com/package/atscntrb-hx-mysession-2) and [npm, multiparty](https://www.npmjs.com/package/atscntrb-hx-mysession-g).

* [ATS/Erlang](https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats/tree/master/contrib/CATS-atscc2erl/TEST/Sessiontype).
